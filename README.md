# Preprocessing data from sensors using pySpark

It is a usual case when you have sensors installed throughout your manufacturing line. Each sensor constantly gives a signal which usually needs to be preprocessed before machine learning techniques can be applied. In the following sections I will describe the use-case, the structure of the data collected from sensors and the way how it should be preprocessed. We will also look at the execution time improvement that can be reached with pySpark.


You can use pySpark locally which is helpfull to prepare your code before running it on server. If you don't have it on your laptop, please, follow this [link](https://blog.sicara.com/get-started-pyspark-jupyter-guide-tutorial-ae2fe84f594f) to install it.
